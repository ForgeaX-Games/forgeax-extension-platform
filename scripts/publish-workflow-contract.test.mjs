// (ForgeaX-Games/forgeax-ci npm-publish.yml). The pipeline's internal structure —
// build/scan/publish separation, no credentials in the publish runner,
// scan-before-publish, pinned npm, no-provenance publish — is contract-tested in
// forgeax-ci itself. Here we only assert that this repo delegates to that shared
// pipeline instead of hand-rolling its own.
